        "\n",
        "What are some limitations you can see with this caching approach? When is this most/least useful for production systems? \n",
        "\n",
        "Consider:\n",
        "- **Memory vs Disk caching trade-offs**\n",
        "- **Cache invalidation strategies** \n",
        "- **Concurrent access patterns**\n",
        "- **Cache size management**\n",
        "- **Cold start scenarios**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Answer:\n",
        "Limitations of this caching approach:\n",
        "1. Memory vs Disk trade-offs:\n",
        "    - Memory caching is fast but gets wiped on restart - you lose all your expensive embeddings\n",
        "    - Disk caching persists but adds I/O overhead, especially for large vector databases\n",
        "    - No hybrid approach shown here\n",
        "2. Cache invalidation issues:\n",
        "    - What happens when your PDF gets updated? The old cached embeddings become stale\n",
        "    - No automatic cache expiration or versioning system\n",
        "    - Could serve outdated information to users   \n",
        "3. Concurrent access problems:\n",
        "    - Multiple users hitting the same cache could cause race conditions\n",
        "    - No locking mechanism shown for cache updates\n",
        "    - Could lead to duplicate API calls if timing is unlucky     \n",
        "4. Cache size management:\n",
        "    - No limits on cache growth - could fill up disk/memory\n",
        "    - No LRU eviction or cleanup strategies\n",
        "    - Cache could become a performance bottleneck if it gets too large  \n",
        "\n",
        "When it's most useful:\n",
        "    - Small teams with consistent document sets\n",
        "    - Development/testing environments where you want to avoid repeated API calls\n",
        "    - Scenarios where the same questions get asked repeatedly\n",
        "\n",
        "When it's least useful:\n",
        "    - High-traffic production systems with constantly changing documents\n",
        "    - Multi-tenant environments where cache isolation is critical\n",
        "    - Real-time applications where cache misses create noticeable delays      "

        "\n",
        "**Your Mission**: Enhance the existing LangGraph agent by adding a **Guardrails validation node** that ensures all interactions are safe, on-topic, and compliant.\n",
        "\n",
        "**📋 Requirements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Create a Guardrails Node**: \n",
        "   - Implement input validation (jailbreak, topic, PII detection)\n",
        "   - Implement output validation (content moderation, factuality)\n",
        "   - Handle guard failures gracefully\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Integrate with Agent Workflow**:\n",
        "   - Add guards as a pre-processing step\n",
        "   - Add guards as a post-processing step  \n",
        "   - Implement refinement loops for failed validations\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Test with Adversarial Scenarios**:\n",
        "   - Test jailbreak attempts\n",
        "   - Test off-topic queries\n",
        "   - Test inappropriate content generation\n",
        "   - Test PII leakage scenarios\n",
        "\n",
        "**🎯 Success Criteria:**\n",
        "- Agent blocks malicious inputs while allowing legitimate queries\n",
        "- Agent produces safe, factual, on-topic responses\n",
        "- System gracefully handles edge cases and provides helpful error messages\n",
        "- Performance remains acceptable with guard overhead\n",
        "\n",
        "**💡 Implementation Hints:**\n",
        "- Use LangGraph's conditional routing for guard decisions\n",
        "- Implement both synchronous and asynchronous guard validation\n",
        "- Add comprehensive logging for security monitoring\n",
        "- Consider guard performance vs security trade-offs\n"
