## Discussion Question #1:
What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?

Vibe checking is a useful first step—it helps catch obvious, high-impact issues quickly. But I also realized it’s not enough on its own. Without structure, it’s easy to miss deeper problems or overestimate system performance. A strong evaluation strategy needs to go beyond surface-level checks and include formal metrics, edge case testing, and coverage across real use scenarios. Vibe checks are good for intuition, but structured evaluation builds bettwer workflows.

**Key limitations:**

Subjectivity: Results depend heavily on the person performing the check, leading to inconsistent evaluations.

Limited coverage: Vibe checks test only a handful of cases, potentially missing issues that appear under different inputs or edge cases.

Lack of repeatability: There’s no standardized process, making it hard to track progress or compare versions over time.

Confirmation bias: Evaluators may unconsciously favor outputs that align with expectations, ignoring weaker responses.

Poor scalability: It’s impractical for evaluating complex systems or large-scale functionality.
