For example, some were unaware their loans had been transferred to different servicers or were not notified when repayment was supposed to start.\\n\\n2. **Difficulty with repayment options:** Several individuals faced limited options like forbearance or deferment, which led to accumulating interest and increasing the total debt. Some felt these options extended the repayment period and made paying off the loans more difficult.\\n\\n3. **Financial hardships and inability to afford payments:** Many borrowers indicated that increasing payments to reduce principal was unaffordable, especially given stagnant wages, inflation, or other financial hardships. This made repayment seem unmanageable.\\n\\n4. **Problems with loan servicing practices:** Complaints include issues like being unable to apply extra payments to principal, servicers applying payments primarily to interest, or being placed on long-term forbearance without proper handling, which prolonged debt.\\n\\n5. **Borrower misunderstandings or lack of information:** Some borrowers were unaware of their repayment obligations, or how interest and balances accrue, leading to unintentional delinquencies or credit issues.\\n\\n6. **Errors and mismanagement:** Complaints also involve incorrect reporting of late payments, inability to access account information, or transfer of loans without proper notification, contributing to difficulties in managing loan repayment.\\n\\nIn summary, failure to repay was often due to a combination of inadequate communication, financial constraints, complex or unfavorable servicing practices, and administrative errors.'"

        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",
