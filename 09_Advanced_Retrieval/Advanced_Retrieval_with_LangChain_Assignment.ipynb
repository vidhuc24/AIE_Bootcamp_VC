        "\n",
        "How Multi-Query Retrieval Solves This:\n",
        "Example: Let's say you ask: \"Why did people fail to pay back their loans?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The system might generate these reformulations:\n",

        "\n",

        "    2. Broader Coverage: Instead of one search, you're now doing 5 searches. You're casting a wider net and catching more relevant documents.\n",

        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",

For example, some were unaware their loans had been transferred to new companies or that they had to start payments, leading to missed payments and negative credit impacts.\\n\\n2. **Compounding interest and market conditions:** Several complaints mentioned that interest continued to accrue while in forbearance or deferment, sometimes causing the loan balance to grow significantly over time. Borrowers felt misled about the long-term costs and were overwhelmed by rising balances due to high interest.\\n\\n3. **Limited or poor payment options:** Borrowers often reported being steered only into forbearance or deferment, which do not reduce the principal and in fact can increase the total amount owed because of accumulated interest. Many felt unavailable options like income-driven repayment plans were not properly offered or explained, which could have made repayment more manageable.\\n\\n4. **Loan management and transfer issues:** There were frequent complaints about mismanagement, unauthorized transfers, and inaccurate reporting of account status to credit bureaus, which negatively affected credit scores and made repayment harder.\\n\\n5. **Economic hardships and circumstances:** Some borrowers faced financial hardships such as unemployment, homelessness, or health issues, which hampered their ability to meet payment obligations. They also noted that taking on loans at a young age, often without full understanding or adequate counseling, contributed to their difficulties.\\n\\n6. **Inadequate support and mismanagement:** Complaints indicated that servicers sometimes failed to provide proper guidance, misapplied payments, or did not respond timely, complicating efforts to manage repayment.\\n\\nIn summary, the failure to pay back loans was largely driven by systemic issues such as poor communication, interest accumulation, limited payment options, mismanagement, and financial hardships, rather than irresponsibility on the borrowers' part.\""

        "\n",
        "#### Answer\n",
        "\n",
        "Semantic chunking would struggle significantly with short, repetitive text like FAQs. Here's why and how I'd fix it:\n",
        "\n",
        "The Problem:\n",
        "When you have FAQ-style content with short, repetitive sentences like \"How do I reset my password? Click the reset button.\" and \"How do I change my email? Click the settings button,\" semantic chunking has very little meaningful variation to work with. All sentences are essentially saying the same thing in slightly different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "How It Would Behave:\n",
        "The algorithm would likely over-chunk, breaking every single sentence into its own tiny chunk because it can't find meaningful semantic boundaries. Since all sentences are so similar semantically, it might just chunk arbitrarily or create chunks that are too small to be useful for retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "My Adjustments:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Increase minimum chunk size - Force the algorithm to combine more sentences together, maybe requiring chunks to be at least 3-5 sentences instead of letting it break at every semantic boundary.\n",
        "- Switch thresholding methods - Change from \"percentile\" to \"standard_deviation\" or \"interquartile\" which are less sensitive to small semantic differences in repetitive content.\n",
        "- Pre-process the content - Group related FAQ items together before chunking (all password questions in one group, all email questions in another) so there's more semantic variety to work with.\n",
        "- Fall back to traditional chunking - For highly repetitive content, sometimes simple character-based or word-based chunking works better than trying to be clever about semantics.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key insight is that semantic chunking works best when there are clear topic shifts and meaningful semantic boundaries. With repetitive FAQ-style content, those boundaries don't really exist, so you need to adjust the algorithm to be less sensitive or use alternative approaches."

        "3. The method shows excellent faithfulness (0.9706), ensuring responses stay true to the retrieved context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cost Considerations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. BM25 is the most cost-effective as it requires no API calls for embeddings or reranking, making it suitable for budget-constrained scenarios.\n",
        "2. Contextual Compression involves additional Cohere reranking costs but provides significant performance improvements that justify the expense for this domain.\n",
        "3. Ensemble methods are the most expensive due to multiple API calls across different retrieval strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Latency Analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. BM25 offers the fastest response times since it's purely keyword-based with no external API dependencies.\n",
        "2. Contextual Compression adds moderate latency due to the reranking step but provides substantial quality improvements.\n",
        "3. Multi-Query and Ensemble methods introduce higher latency due to multiple parallel retrievals and LLM calls for query generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Contextual Compression is Optimal:\n",
        "\n",
        "For loan complaint data, accuracy and comprehensiveness are critical since users need reliable information about their financial situations. The Cohere reranking step effectively filters out noise while preserving relevant context, resulting in the highest factual correctness scores. The additional cost and latency are justified by the significant improvement in answer quality, especially important for financial domain applications where accuracy is paramount. The method's ability to maintain perfect precision while improving recall makes it ideal for this structured, domain-specific dataset where users expect precise, factual responses about their loan-related queries."
