# Build 🏗️

First, let's clone the MCP Session repository.

```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:AI-Maker-Space/AIE7-MCP-Session.git
```

Next, we're going to add our own tool to the flow - this will be achieved through adding tools in the `server.py`.

That's it, that's all folks!

# Ship 🚢

# Share 🚀
- Walk through your app and explain what you've completed in the Loom video
- Make a social media post about your final application and tag @AIMakerspace
- Share 3 lessons learned
- Share 3 lessons not learned
